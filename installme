These are instructions for manually installing the developer version of the ptxplus package on a typical Ubuntu operating system (Jaunty +). Ultimately we want ptxplus to completely install from the package but at this point, given the state of flux it is in, it is best to get the latest code from the repository and manually install it. Most of the installation commands here will be done in the terminal. If you have not opened a terminal yet, do it now.


PYTHON
Nothing in this package will work without Python. Be sure you have Python 2.5 installed on your system.


GETTING ptxplus
To obtain the ptxplus, you need to check it out from the Mercurial repository it resides in. To simplify these instructions we will assume that the ptxplus package will go in this location:

	~/Projects

Create the above path if it does not exist or adjust the commands to suite your system.

If you do not have the Mercurial distributed version control system installed on your system, use this command to install the package and the Meld differential file viewing program as well:

	sudo apt-get install mercurial meld

Now you can to go to the Palaso website and clone the project code with:

	hg clone http://hg.palaso.org/ptxplus ~/Projects/ptxplus

That should put ptxplus where you need it. From time to time you may want to update it. To do that, from inside the ptxplus project folder (~/Projects/ptxplus), this is the command you need:

	hg pull


INSTALLATION
For easier operation it is necessary to get ptxplus properly registered in your system. The first thing that needs to be done is to link ptxplus.conf file to /etc folder. That is done with:

	sudo ln -s ~/Projects/ptxplus/bin/ptxplus.conf /etc/ptxplus.conf

Now we will get ptxplus in your path by editing the ~/.profile file. To do that use this command:

	sudo gedit ~/.profile

Add this to the end of that file (on its own line):

	export PTXPLUS_BASE="$HOME/Projects/ptxplus"

Next time you reboot or login, the new path settings will be there.

If you don't want to reboot right now and you just want to get it working on the current login use:

	source ~/.profile

Test to see if the system recognizes the additional path with:

	echo $PTXPLUS_BASE

Next we need link ptxplus (main program) to /usr/local/bin so it can be started from any location like a real program would. To do that do:

	sudo ln -s ~/Projects/ptxplus/bin/ptxplus /usr/local/bin/ptxplus

This should complete the manual installation of ptxplus. Now you should be able to start the program from anywhere with:

	ptxplus

If you start it from the root of a project folder it should find the project.conf file and automatically load that project.

Have fun!
