====== Managing Maps ======
The finer points of how to work with maps in ptxplus. Maps are really a part of the peripheral matter but since they require a significant amount of work they get their own page.

=== Summary ===
Producing a map, or set of maps, is a three step process.
1) Edit the project.conf maps_data.csv files
2) Edit the project SVG map files
3) Produce the PDF files and bind

=== Color Management ===
Some printers require CMYK color space for the color material you give them. As the maps are generated with Inkscape, RGB is the default and there is no real CMYK output at this point.

The way to fulfill this requirement is to take the PDF that you generated with the system and import it in the Gimp. The Gimp does a good job of importing PDF files. Use about 600 dpi as your desired output resolution. Once the import is done, use the Separate plugin to generate a CMYK file in the TIFF format.

The Separate plugin is included in an Ubuntu package called gimp-plugin-registry and icc-profiles. However, these packages do not come installed with a standard Gimp installation. You will need to install them if they are not already. (Remember to exit the Gimp first, then restart it when you are finished.) To install the gimp-plugin-registry and icc-profiles use the Synaptic package manager or, open a terminal and type the following line:

	sudo apt-get install gimp-plugin-registry icc-profiles

Use the Separate plugin to create a new image of the imported map. It will have four layers in it, one for each color. Next, use the Separate plugin to save the layered CMYK file into a merged CYMK TIFF file that is suitable for printing separations. You cannot use any other format than TIFF. Save all your files in the Maps folder.

Next, in the terminal located in the Maps folder, use the "convert" utility, which is part of [[ImageMagick]] package, to embed your new CMYK TIFF file into a PDF file. The command line would be something  like this:

	convert m006-CMYK.tif m006-CMYK.pdf

Next, still in the terminal, link the new PDF files to the process directory with something like:

	cd ../Process
	ln -sf [[../Maps/m006-CMYK.pdf]] .

Now open up the MAPS.USFM file in your Text folder and edit the necessary lines so that it will now point to the new CMYK PDF files you have made. This will generate a new version of the MAPS.USFM.pdf file. Be sure to copy it into the deliverables folder and rename it to indicate that it contains content in the CMYK color space.

=== Map Templates ===
Currently there are 11 map templates to choose from. Here is a brief description of each one:

'''
m001 = Modern world
m002 = Ancient world
m003 = Exodus from Egypt
m004 = Conquest of Canaan
m005 = Kingdoms of Israel and Judah
m006 = Holy Land in the Time of Jesus Christ
m007 = Jerusalem in New Testament Times
m008 = Paul's Missionary Journeys
m009 = The Temple in the time of Jesus Christ
m010 = Seven Churches of Asia
m011 = The Temple Buildings
'''
