====== Ptx2pdf ======

This page contains information on finer points of the ptx2pdf macro package

If what you need is not on this page you might want to check out the iCap ptx2pdf forum page. It has lots of useful information on using the ptx2pdf macros. However, remember that some features of ptxplus will not be covered there as they are not part of the original ptx2pdf macro package. The iCap ptx2pdf forum can be found here:

==== Hanging Verse Numbers ====
For poetry sometimes the client will want the verse number flushed left against the margin. These are some clues as to what you might do to make this happen:

In your setup file add: \def\HangVerseAlignMarker{qv}

Make a new style:
\Marker qv
\LeftMargin .1

There is more that needs to be described here but it will need to be done by someone who has actually done it. Sorry if this doesn't help you.

==== Title Page Page Numbers ====
For some audiences, it is helpful to have a page number on the first page. For newer readers it makes better sense to have the TOC pointing to a real number on the page. However, the title page could be on odd or even page depending on where it lands when it is typeset. To ensure that the page number ends up in the right place some extra testing code can be entered in the field that normally contains the key word for the running footer or header. For example, if you wanted to have the page number on the outside of the title page, the header, this would work:

\def\RHtitleleft{\ifodd\pageno\empty\else\pagenumber\fi}
\def\RHtitlecenter{\empty}
\def\RHtitleright{\ifodd\pageno\pagenumber\else\empty\fi}

Similar code could be applied to the footer as well.

==== Peripheral Page Numbers ====
Depending on the markup used, it may be difficult to get a page number to work right on peripheral matter. The problem seems to revolve around the use of \ixx markers for introductory material. The page output routine does not seem to recognize what is going on. One work-around is to put a \v_ZWSP (\v followed by a space and then a ZWSP character). This may fool ptx2pdf to output page numbers as desired by the header/footer settings.
