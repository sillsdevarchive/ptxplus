====== Styles ======

The style file (.sty) functions within the [[TeX]] publishing system. Here are some tips to working with the style file.

===== Note Order =====
The order in which the notes at the bottom of the page appear is dependent on how [[TeX]] reads in the styles in the style file. For example if the "Marker f" style is defined before the "Marker x" style, footnotes will be output before cross references on the bottom of the page. Change them around and the order will be reversed.

===== Small Caps =====
In Latin text, for the \sc, \nd and perhaps a couple of other character style markers the "small caps" feature can be provided as long as the font supports it. Right now, the only Latin font in the SIL repertoire that can provide small caps is Charis SIL version 4.106 available at: http://scripts.sil.org/CharisSIL_download

To invoke the small caps feature (which is implemented as an [[OpenType]] feature), in the project style file (ptx2pdf.sty), find the style marker you wish to use this feature with. Next, insert this code into the style definition on its own line:

	\FontName "[../Fonts/CharisSIL/CharisSILR.ttf]:+smcp"

Remember that this will only work with a font that has this feature added to the font. If you are using a font other than Charis that has the small caps feature, you may need to consult the documentation for the right syntax for evoking that particular feature.

===== Selah and \qs =====
It should be possible to get the 'Selah' of Psalms, marked up as \qs selah\qs* to become right justified with the following hook. The assumption is the \ps always occurs at the end of a paragraph (marked with \q or similar). This hook for the \qs style should work:

	\sethook{before}{qs}{\hfill\null\nobreak\hfill}


===== Overriding Typeface Styles =====
If you are using custom style files that are dependent on a parent style file, you might find it necessary to override the typeface style. For example, if you had the typeface set to bold but you wanted to override with italic, you might find that in the end you will end up with bold-italic. To overcome this, you can simply slip a "Regular" in the override style and then follow it with bold. The override would look something like this:

	\Marker s2
	\Regular
	\Bold



===== Adding Color to Styles =====
To add an RGB color to a specific style you need to add a hook to the style such as this:

\sethook{start}{v}{\special{color push rgb 0.13 0.54 0.13}}


\sethook{end}{v}{\special{color pop}}

This gives you Forest Green on the selected style. The numbers are percentage of R, G, and B. Go here for an RGB color chart:

Whereas 100% = 1, 13% = 0.13, etc...

This will push an RGB color to the color stack. Then, after the marker is over, it pops the color off the stack so the following text will be back to the previous color.

If the CMYK color space is desired replace 'rgb' with 'cmyk' and follow with four percentage numbers rather than three. Example:

\sethook{start}{v}{\special{color push cmyk 1 0 1 0.5}}


\sethook{end}{v}{\special{color pop}}

This will give you green cmyk(100%, 0%, 100%, 50%)

A CMYK color chart can be found here:

==== Flying Verse Numbers ====
To set the vertical distance between verse numbers when using flying verse numbers. You need to insert in the [[.sty]] this command in the verse marker: \BaseLine 10pt This can help prevent clashing when using number systems in which the character baseline can vary from number to number. The default behavior is to use the font size. If this is too close you will want to change the number as desired.

==== Adding Leading to Section Heads ====
A simple hook that will add leading (space between the lines) of section headings works like this:
\sethook{start}{s1}{\baselineskip=14pt \relax}

Change the {s1} to whatever marker you are working with and change the pt setting to suite the font and space you desire.
