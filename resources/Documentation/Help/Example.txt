====== Example Project ======

ptxplus comes with an example project that can be used to test or demonstrate the system. Installation of the project is easily accessed through the ptxplus interface by clicking on Menu -> Help -> Example, or, in the terminal, type:

	ptxplus example <path>

If you do not enter a path ptxplus will deposit the example project in a folder called ptxplus-example in the current working folder.

The installation only takes a moment and when it is done you will need to open the project up in the ptxplus interface. In the menu click on File -> Open and then just navigate to the newly created project.

Have fun!
