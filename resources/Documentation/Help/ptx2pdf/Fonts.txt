====== Fonts ======

==== Font Handling ====
Some tips for working with fonts.

Fonts to use for "plain", "bold", "italic", and "bold italic" from the Paratext stylesheet (they need not really be italic, etc, of course) There are also some extra options that can be added to the font def command they would be:
	embolden=n	Fake bold command, start with 2
	letterspace=n	Extra character space, start with 5

These commands go after the font name. Remember to put a ":" between the name and the first command and a ";" between commands.

This is an example of how to use system fonts. If you do this you need to comment out the line above to avoid errors. SIL Charis - Installed in the OS system fonts folder
	\def\regular{"Charis SIL"}	\def\bold{"Charis SIL/B"}
	\def\italic{"Charis SIL/I"}	\def\bolditalic{"Charis SIL/BI"}

To force TeX to make a font "bold" use a command something like:
\def\bold{"My Font Name:embolden=2"}

Change the embolden setting as needed
