====== Footnotes ======

==== Justification ====
Until recently the default (hardwired) was for footnotes to be ragged
right.  Now, Justification can be set in the marker \f (and \x).  The
default is now fully justified.  Earlier behavior can be returned
with \Justification Left.

==== Line Spacing ====
To adjust the vertical line spacing for footnotes add "\BaseLine 10pt" (or whatever pt size it needs to be) to the \f marker in the .sty file. the same would work for cross references (\x).

==== Footnote Rule ====
To change or adjust the footnote rule you need to use or adjust the \def\footnoterule{} setting. [Note, this has not been tested but you should be able to change the rule character by entering another character in the setting like \footnoterule{*} should change it to be all asterisk, not that you would want to do that. If you leave the setting in the setup file but do not put a character in it, the rule will not be used at all - in theory.]
