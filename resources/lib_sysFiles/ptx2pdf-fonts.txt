% This is an auto-generated file which defines the fonts that
% TeX will use to proecess the text of this project. Edit as
% necessary.

% This next line is a TeX tweak that alows us to use full path names
% which enables us to keep the font in the project and not rely on
% the system to provide the font. The relative path assumes starting
% in the Process folder which is at the same level as the Fonts
% folder
