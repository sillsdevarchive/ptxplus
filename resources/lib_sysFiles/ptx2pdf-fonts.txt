% This is an auto-generated file which defines the fonts that
% TeX will use to proecess the text of this project. Edit as
% necessary.

% This next line is a TeX tweak that alows us to use full path names
% which enables us to keep the font in the project and not rely on
% the system to provide the font. The relative path assumes starting
% in the Process folder which is at the same level as the Fonts
% folder

% SIL GenBkBas - found in the _resources/fonts folder
% Note that by default Graphite rendering is turned on.
% It may not be needed in cases where simple Latin
% text is being rendered. However, for complex scripts
% Roman or otherwise, it should be turned on if the
% font supports it.
