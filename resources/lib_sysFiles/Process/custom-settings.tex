%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Extra Tweaks %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% In a perfect world none of these would be needed but when your publication
% throws you a curve, perhaps one of these work-arounds might help you do what
% you want to do.


%%%%% BASELINESKIP ADJUSTMENT HOOK
% This hook provides a means to adjust the baselineskip on a specific style.
% (Does not work with some markers like \fig) It provides a place to put the
% initial setting so the hook can make the change and then go back to the
% initial setting when done.
\newdimen\remblskip \remblskip=\baselineskip

% Baselineskip Adjustment Hook Example
%\sethook{start}{s1}{\remblskip=\baselineskip \baselineskip=10pt}
%\sethook{after}{s1}{\baselineskip=\remblskip}


%%%%% WORKING TEXT LINE SPACING
%%%%% Take out a little space between lines in working text
\def\suckupline{\vskip -\baselineskip}
\def\suckuphalfline{\vskip -0.5\baselineskip}

%%%%% Skip some space in the working text
\def\skipline{\vskip\baselineskip}
\def\skiphalfline{\vskip 0.5\baselineskip}
\def\skipqline{\vskip 0.25\baselineskip}


%%%%% ADDITIONAL MARGINAL VERSE SETTINGS
% For marginal verse output we need to insert this right here.  This should be
% temporary.  It allows one stylesheet to undo superscript in a previous one It
% needs to go right here to keep everything else working
%
% This is needed to turn off superscript in the override stylesheet
%\catcode`\@=11
%\def\NoSuperscript  {\defp@ram{superscript}{false}}
%\catcode`\@=12
%
% In the override stylesheet (to follow) we need this to be
% inserted for \v:
% \Marker v
% \sethook{start}{v}{\kern-3sp}
% \FontSize 8
% \Bold
% \NoSuperscript

%%%%% HEADER OUTPUT
% To adjust the size of the page number in the header or footer use the
% following code.  Adjust font name and size as necessary.
% \font\mysmallfont="[../Fonts/CharisSIL/CharisSILB.ttf]" at 10pt
%\def\pagenumber{{\mysmallfont \folio}}

% This will output only the book name in the header that is found in \h. (This
% should be added to ptx2pdf.)
\catcode`\@=11
\def\bookname{\x@\extr@ctfirst\p@gefirstmark\relax\@book}
\catcode`\@=12

%%%%% FOOTNOTE TWEAKS
% Footnote caller kerning - To adjust space around the footnote caller use the
% following code Adjust the kern amounts as necessary
\let\OriginalGetCaller=\getcaller
\def\getcaller#1#2{%
  \kern0.2em\OriginalGetCaller{#1}{#2}\kern0.4em}

% INTER NOTE SKIP
% Adjust the horizontal space between footnotes, both paragraphed and
% non-paragraphed
\catcode`\@=11
  \intern@teskip=10pt
\catcode`\@=12

% INTER-NOTE PENALTY
% Control the amount of "tension" between parts of a footnote to help control
% line breaking.  If you use the highest setting, 10000, it will never break.  A
% lower setting, like 9999, will lossen it up.  Default is 9999.
\def\internotepenalty{9999}


%%%%% QUOTE CHARACTER KERNING
% Add some space between quote marks that are together.
%\quotekernamount = 0.1em


%%%%% SUBSTITUTING CHARACTERS
% Some times, when a character does not exist in a font you can substitute from
% another if no special rendering is needed.  This code will do that.  Uncomment
% and modify as needed.  This will put more cwi in your life :-)
%\font\cwi="[../Fonts/Padauk/Padauk.ttf]" at 10pt
%\catcode"A92E=\active				% Make U+A92E an active character
%\def^^^^a92e{\leavevmode{\cwi\char"A92E}}	% Define it to print itself  in \cwi


%%%%% NON-STANDARD SPACES
% Some publications may use non-standard (U+0020) between words.  But TeX (and
% XeTeX) will treat spaces other than U+0020 as non-breaking which messes up
% your justification.  This is a work around to force TeX to break and stretch
% words with another space character in a controled way.
%\catcode"2009=13
%\def^^^^2009{\hskip .2em plus.1em minus.1em\relax}


%%%%% LINE BREAKING
% Some Graphite fonts can break lines on syllables.  Burmese script would be an
% example of this.  To get lines to break where you need them (if that service
% exists in the font) uncomment the following command.
%\XeTeXlinebreaklocale "G"


%%%%% HEADING SPACE
% There always seems to be problems with extra space between the section heading
% and the top of the column when the section head is at the top of the column.
% To take up the slack this code will usually help.  Any adjustments needed
% should be done in the .sty and \VerticalSpaceFactor.  Trying to adjust this
% code doesn't seem to make any dif.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TOC Generation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The following code controls the layout of the TOC file This code can be
% addjusted to get the right look to your TOC.  You can also adjust the \toc<n>
% styles found in the .sty file.  The functions that are embedded in the TOC
% file are:
%	\tbltwowlheader{lable1}{label3}
%	\tbltwowlrow{val1}{val3}
% Or, if you wish a three column layout you could use this:
%	\tblthreewlheader{lable1}{label3}
%	\tblthreewlrow{val1}{val3}
% Other layouts, more code will be need to be added.
% To change the leader, leader spacing and other general
% layout formating, adjust the settings below.

\catcode`@=11

% These are custom settings that can go in the .tex file to adjust elements on
% the page. The defaults are set here.
\def\myleader{.}		% The leader character
\def\leaderspace{0.6em}		% The space between the leader characters
\def\tblmarginright{0in}	% The width of the table's right margin
\def\tblheaderspace{4pt}	% The space between the header and the first row
\def\tblrowspace{4pt}		% The space between rows of the table
\def\tblthreewcolmngap{.75in}	% The space between col 1 & 2 on a three col table

% Macro code for leadered two colum layout:
% FIXME: There is a problem with \tbltwowllabel not being set when there is no
% \tbltwowlheader used.  Something has to be done with
% "\tbltwowllabel=\wd0\box0\par\vskip \tblheaderspace" that needs to be set
% because it is used in \tbltwowlrow.  If that doesn't get set you end up with
% overfull boxes on your page numbers. There needs to be a way this can be set
% independent from \tbltwowlheader. A work around for now is when you have a TOC
% which does not need a header row, put an em space (U+2001) in place of any
% data you would put in there. This way it just prints out the row with nothing
% in it and it just takes up space.
