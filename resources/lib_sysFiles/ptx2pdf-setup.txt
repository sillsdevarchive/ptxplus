% This file defines some basic parameters that control
% the format of the output when used together with the
% Paratext stylesheet


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                   Begin Setup Params
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Basic Page Layout %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Number of columns to use for the title, introduction, and
% body text sections
\TitleColumns=1
\IntroColumns=1
\BodyColumns=2

% ColumnGutterFactor - To adjust the width of the column
% gutter, default=15
%\def\ColumnGutterFactor{15}

% ColumnGutterRuletrue - Whether to place a vertical line
% between the columns in the column gutter. (default = no rule)
%\ColumnGutterRuletrue

% ColumnGutterRuleSkip - It may be necessary to push the top
% of the gutter rule down a few points. This allows you to
% do that.
%\ColumnGutterRuleSkip=4pt

% Columnshift - This is used for marginal verses. It will
% shift the columns over so the page apears more balanced.
% 15pt is the default setting.
%\columnshift=15pt

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Other Page Options %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% JustifyParsfalse - Paragraph justification, default is
% true, uncomment to turn off
%\JustifyParsfalse

% Do not eject the page at the end of a book to save space.
% Default behaviour is to eject after every book. Uncomment
% this to prevent it from ejecting.
%\endbooknoejecttrue

% CropMarkstrue - Need crop marks?
\CropMarkstrue

% Add a Draft watermark to each page. To use, uncomment and
% and be sure the file name is valid.
%\def\PageBorder{DraftWatermark-60.pdf}

% MarginUnit - Basic unit for margins; changing this will
% alter them all
\MarginUnit=1cm

% Relative sizes of margins, based on the unit above.
% There is also control on where the header and footer
% goes. Here are some guidelines:
%
% TopMarginFactor (and BottomMarginFactor, if separately specified)
% will relate just to the margins of the body text area, independent
% of headers and footers.
\def\TopMarginFactor{1.5}
\def\BottomMarginFactor{1.25}

% \SideMarginFactor determins the distance between the edge of the
% page and the body text.
\def\SideMarginFactor{1.0}

% \HeaderPosition and \FooterPosition (with defaults of perhaps 0.5)
% will control the position of the header and footer. These are also
% in terms of \MarginUnit, and give the position of the baseline of
% the header/footer relative to the top/bottom edge of the paper (not
% the text area).
\def\HeaderPosition{.5}
\def\FooterPosition{.5}

% \BindingGutter and \BindingGuttertrue will add more to the gutter
% margin so binding can be applied to the binding edge of the page.
% Be sure to add the same amount to the page width.
%\BindingGutter=12mm
%\BindingGuttertrue

%%%%% Turn Off Graphics
% Uncomment and ptx2pdf will not output the actual picture
% graphic, just the space it goes in. This makes it much faster.
%\FigurePlaceholderstrue


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Font setup %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Fonts to use for "plain", "bold", "italic", and "bold italic"
% from the Paratext stylesheet
% (they need not really be italic, etc, of course)
% There are also some extra options that can be added to the
% font def command they would be
%	embolden=n	Fake bold command, start with 2
%	letterspace=n	Extra character space, start with 5
% These commands go after the font name. Remember to put
% a ":" between the name and the first command and a ";"
% between commands.

% Font Input File - We need a more automated way to handle
% fonts so I have created a an external auto-generated font
% def. file to facilitate this. This next input points to an
% external file that contains the font defs for this project.
\input ptx2pdf-fonts.txt

% This is an example of how to use system fonts. If you do this
% you need to comment out the line above to avoid errors.
% SIL Charis - Installed in the OS system fonts folder
%	\def\regular{"Charis SIL"}	\def\bold{"Charis SIL/B"}
%	\def\italic{"Charis SIL/I"}	\def\bolditalic{"Charis SIL/BI"}

% To force TeX to make a font "bold" use a command something like:
%\def\bold{"My Font Name:embolden=2"}
% Change the embolden setting as needed

% tracinglostchars - To figure out which glyphes are missing
% from your font use this to get glyph report output in your
% log file:
%\tracinglostchars=1

% RTLtrue - Uncomment to use right-to-left layout mode
%\RTLtrue

% FontSizeUnit - Unit for font sizes in the stylesheet;
% changing this will scale all text proportionately
\FontSizeUnit=1pt

% LineSpacingFactor - Scaling factor used to adjust line
% spacing (leading), relative to font size; default={1.2}
\def\LineSpacingFactor{1.1}

% VerticalSpaceFactor - Scaling factor used to adjust amount
% of vertical spaces applied for usfm.sty SpaceBefore and
% SpaceAfter values; default={0.2}
\def\VerticalSpaceFactor{1}

% XeTeXlinebreaklocale - For breaking on sylilables, if
% you are using a Graphite font that supports this
%\XeTeXlinebreaklocale "G"

% To adjust the size of the page number in the header or footer
% use the following code. Adjust font name and size as necessary.
%\font\mysmallfont="[../Fonts/CharisSIL/CharisSILB.ttf]" at 10pt
%\def\pagenumber{{\mysmallfont \folio}}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Header Configuration %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This will output only the book name in the header that is
% found in \h. (This should be added to ptx2pdf.)
\catcode`\@=11
\def\bookname{\x@\extr@ctfirst\p@gefirstmark\relax\@book}
\catcode`\@=12

% Information to include in the running header (at top of
% pages, except first) We set the items to print at
% left/center/right of odd and even pages separately
% Possible contents:
%	\bookname = the name of the book as defined in \h
%   \rangeref = Scripture reference of the range of text on the page;
%   \firstref = reference of the first verse on the page)
%   \lastref = reference of the last verse on the page)
%   \pagenumber = the page number
%   \empty = print nothing in this position

\def\RHoddleft{\empty} % Inside of the page
\def\RHoddcenter{\pagenumber}
\def\RHoddright{\rangeref} % Outside of the page

\def\RHevenleft{\rangeref} % Outside of the page
\def\RHevencenter{\pagenumber}
\def\RHevenright{\empty} % Inside of the page

% RHruleposition - Position of rule under the running head
% if used. It is measured from the baseline of the header.
% This is a simple dimension, not a relative "factor".
% Default is commented out to hide the rule
\RHruleposition=6pt

% VerseRefstrue - Include verse number (true) in running
% head, or only chapter
\VerseRefstrue

% Footer Configuration, leave them empty if you don't want
% anything to show up in the footer, like page numbers on
% the first page.

\def\RFoddcenter{\empty}
\def\RFevencenter{\empty}
\def\RFtitlecenter{\empty}

% Put a page number on the bottom of the title page so
% the TOC makes more sense to newer readers. This is
% turned on by default so the question is asked early
% in the project setup. Turn it off (comment it) only
% if you know the client doesn't want it.
\def\RFtitleleft{\empty}
\def\RFtitlecenter{\pagenumber}
\def\RFtitleright{\empty}

% Same as above but it will put the number on the top-outside
% of the Title page when that is the normal position. This
% is turned off by default.
%\def\RHtitleleft{\ifodd\pageno\empty\else\pagenumber\fi}
%\def\RHtitlecenter{\empty}
%\def\RHtitleright{\ifodd\pageno\pagenumber\else\empty\fi}

% PageBorder - Define this to add a border to all pages, from
% a PDF file containing the graphic "scaled <factor>" adjusts
% the size (1000 would keep the border at its original size)
% Can also use "xscaled 850 yscaled 950" to scale separately
% in each direction, or "width 5.5in height 8in" to scale to
% a known size.
%\def\PageBorder{tuborder.pdf scaled 825}

% ChapterVerseSeparator - Adjust the space or change the
% character used for the chapter verse seperator. The default
% is "." I like to use a ":".
\def\ChapterVerseSeparator{\kern.02em:\kern.02em}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Footnote Settings %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Footnote modifications, edit as needed.

% AutoCallerStartChar – Unicode value of first character to
% use for auto-generated callers; default=97 ('a')
%\AutoCallerStartChar{}

% AutoCallerNumChars – Number of caller characters to generate
% before restarting sequence; default=26
%\AutoCallerNumChars{}

% AutoCallers{f|x}{callers csv} – Make the note class use a
% specific sequence of symbols
%     o \AutoCallers{f}{,?,?,¶,§,*,,,¶¶,§§}
%     o \AutoCallers{x}{}
%\AutoCallers{f}{\kern0.2em*\kern0.4em}

% NumericCallers{f|x} – Make the note class use numeric
% (instead of alphabetic) callers
%\NumericCallers{x}

% PageResetCallers{f|x} – Restart numbering for the notes
% class on each page
%\PageResetCallers{x}

% OmitCallerInNote{f|x} – To omit callers from the note
% class at the bottom of the page
%\OmitCallerInNote{f}

% ParagraphedNotes{f|x} – Format the note class as a single
% paragraph, with larger space between note items. The command
% has to be repeated if more than one kind of note is going
% to be paragraphed. For example:
%	\ParagraphedNotes{f}
%	\ParagraphedNotes{x}
% would allow both footnotes and cross references to be
% paragraphed.
%\ParagraphedNotes{f}

% footnoterule - To change or turn off footnote rule
%\def\footnoterule{}

% Footnote caller kerning - To adjust space around the
% footnote caller use the following code Adjust the kern
% amounts as necessary
%\let\OriginalGetCaller=\getcaller
%\def\getcaller#1#2{%
%  \kern0.2em\OriginalGetCaller{#1}{#2}\kern0.4em}

% Inter Note Skip - Adjust the horizontal space between footnotes,
% both paragraphed and non-paragraphed
\catcode`\@=11
  \intern@teskip=10pt
\catcode`\@=12

% To adjust the vertical line spacing for footnotes add
% "\BaseLine 10pt" (or whatever pt size it needs to be) to
% the \f marker in the .sty file

% Inter-note Penalty - Control the amount of "tension" between
% parts of a footnote to help control line breaking. If you
% use the highest setting, 10000, it will never break. A lower
% setting, like 9999, will lossen it up. Default is 9999.
\def\internotepenalty{9999}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% File Locations %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The file locations rely on relative paths and also setting
% the TEXINPUTS environment. With the right inputs set this
% should all work.

%%%%% Master PTX Stylesheet
% Define the Paratext stylesheet to be used as a basis for formatting
% This first stylesheet contains standard USFM formats. Do not modify!
% By default this is commented out because the only place your project
% should be getting it's style info is from the project style sheet.
% This is only used as a back up and anything in the project style
% sheet will override these default format settings.
%\stylesheet{usfm.sty}

%%%%% Additional Marginal Verse Settings
% For marginal verse output we need to insert this right here.
% This should be temporary. It allows one stylesheet to undo
% superscript in a previous one It needs to go right here to
% keep everything else working
%
% This is needed to turn off superscript in the override stylesheet
%\catcode`\@=11
%\def\NoSuperscript  {\defp@ram{superscript}{false}}
%\catcode`\@=12
%
% In the override stylesheet (to follow) we need this to be
% inserted for \v:
% \Marker v
% \sethook{start}{v}{\kern-3sp}
% \FontSize 8
% \Bold
% \NoSuperscript

% This next stylesheet containes all the format styles for a project.
% If the default style sheet is activated, this one will override
% any settings in that file.
\stylesheet{ptx2pdf.sty}

%%%%% Illustrations
% If you are using illustrations this will tell XeTeX where
% to find the picture files. This is reletive to where the
% .tex control file is.
\PicPath={Illustrations/}

%%%%% Hyphenation
% This will pull in any hyphenation info we need for this job
% Because it may be needed in other projects we store it in
% a more centrally accessible place for this project.
% If the language you are typesetting already has pre-defined
% hyphenation rules in TeX (like English) you can just
% comment out the following line. Otherwise it will use
% whatever rules that have been put in the word list. If
% nothing is found, no hyphenation will be done on the text.
\input hyphenation.tex


%%%%%%%%%%%%% Versification Format Settings %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%% Marginal Verses
% This will allow us to have marginal verses. It calls in the
% code from another file. (This seems to have to be located
% here. In other locations it gives unpredictable results.)
%\input "ptxplus-marginalverses.tex"

%%%%% Verse number handling
% To stop it from outputing a verse #1 on in-line verses use:
%\OmitVerseNumberOnetrue

%%%%% Extra space after verse and chapter numbers
% Some times you might need a little extra space following the
% verse or chapter numbers. These two override parameters
% will change those spaces. The amount is related to the
% \FontSizeUnit, so it scales with the text. This can be used
% with both in-line and marginal verse layouts.
%\def\AfterVerseSpaceFactor{2}
%\def\AfterChapterSpaceFactor{3}

% To set the vertical distance between verse numbers when
% using flying verse numbers. You need to insert in the .sty
% this command in the verse marker: \BaseLine 10pt
% This can help prevent clashing when using number systems
% in which the character baseline can vary from number to
% number. The default behavior is to use the font size. If this
% is too close you will want to change the number as desired.

% For additional settings concerning marginal verses look
% in the file location settings. Some settings may need
% to be made around there if you are using marginal verses


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TOC Generation %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% GenerateTOC -The following command will auto-generate a
% TOC file in the Process folder. The information found
% in that file can then be used to build the final TOC file.
\GenerateTOC[Table of Contents]{toc-auto.usfm}

% As for how to generate the final TOC, that process is
% under heavy development yet. It is fairly manual right
% now and not documented very well.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Extra Tweaks %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% In a perfect world none of these would be needed but when
% your publication throws you a curve, perhaps one of these
% work-arounds might help you do what you want to do.

%%%%% Character Kerning
% Add some space between quote marks that are together.
%\quotekernamount = 0.1em

%%%%% Substituting Characters
% Some times, when a character does not exist in a font
% you can substitute from another if no special rendering
% is needed. This code will do that. Uncomment and modify
% as needed. This will put more cwi in your life :-)
%\font\cwi="[../Fonts/Padauk/Padauk.ttf]" at 10pt
%\catcode"A92E=\active				% Make U+A92E an active character
%\def^^^^a92e{\leavevmode{\cwi\char"A92E}}	% Define it to print itself  in \cwi

%%%%% Non-standard Spaces
% Some publications may use non-standard (U+0020) between words.
% But TeX (and XeTeX) will treat spaces other than U+0020 as
% non-breaking which messes up your justification. This is a
% work around to force TeX to break and stretch words with
% another space character in a controled way.
%\catcode"2009=13
%\def^^^^2009{\hskip .2em plus.1em minus.1em\relax}

% There always seems to be problems with extra space between
% the section heading and the top of the column when the
% section head is at the top of the column. To take up the
% slack this code will usually help. Any adjustments needed
% should be done in the .sty and \VerticalSpaceFactor.
% Trying to adjust this code doesn't seem to make any dif.
\catcode`\@=11
\def\gridb@x#1{%
 \setbox0=\ifgridp@c\vbox{\box#1}\else\killd@scenders#1\fi%
 \dimen2=\ht0 \advance\dimen2 by \dp0
 \dimen0=\baselineskip \vskip\baselineskip
 \ifgridp@c\line{}\nobreak\fi % otherwise first \line in loop won't get any baselineskip

	\line{}\nobreak \repeat
 \setbox0=\vbox to 0pt{\kern-\ht0\unvbox0}
 \unvbox0 \nobreak
}
\catcode`\@=12

%%%%% Get Rid of Over Full Warnings
% Surpress (if necessary) the vbox over full warning when
% when line spacing gets tight. If you use it edit the pt
% according to what you need. Keep in mind that you might
% be able to prevent an overful \vbox by changing your top
% and/or bottom margins.
%\vfuzz = 2.5pt

%%%%% Get Rid of Uggly Black Boxes
% This might help prevent the black boxes from appearing
% at the end of some lines if that is a problem. Edit as
% needed.
%\hfuzz=0.75pt
