# The styles in this file over-ride those in the Paratext style sheet
# named usfm.sty, this is the parent file for this one. The styles listed
# in this file can contain extra commands not normally used in Paratext.
# It is recomended that no changes be made to usfm.sty file but that
# any over-rides be found here. See the documentation for more
# information.
# Please note that the override commands only need to contain the
# parts of the original command that you wish to override. This will
# save some space and time.
