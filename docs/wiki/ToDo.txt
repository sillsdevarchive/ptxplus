====== ToDo ======

Here we will collect a list of things that need doing. Hopefully we can keep them up. If they are a big task then it would be good to create a separate page and link to this one.

===== pdf2ptx Work =====

==== Page Number Control ====
There needs to be better control of page numbers on peripheral material. Right now it is necessary to insert a "dummy" \v in an introduction section to get the page number to appear on the second page of a section.

==== Flying Verses Overlaping (auto-bridge needed) ====
In cases like 1 Thess. 5:16-17 verse 16 can be really short so that it will cause the verse 17 number to be over-print. We need to find a way to auto-bridge in these instances.

===== Makefile Work =====

==== matter_peripheral.mk ====
Come up with a way to process the TOC separately for the NT and OT. And while we're at it, find a way to generate a TOC for both together if a switch is set.

===== Templates Needed =====

==== COVER_SPINE.USFM/TEX ====
This template exists but it needs to be modified with some [[TeX]] code that will allow you to paste in the text you want on the spine of the cover. Then when it is processed, it will turn the text the right way. After that you could control the size of the text and the horizontal and vertical positions from the [[.tex]] file. This would greatly simplify making the cover's spine page.
