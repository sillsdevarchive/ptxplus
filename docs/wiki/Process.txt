====== Process ======
Created Friday 02 October 2009

This document will describe the tasks or processes the ptxplus system performs. It is meant to be a guide to help design the API for ptxplus.

In it's design, there are several rules ptxplus tries to always maintain.

1) Every task is done with a command line call
2) Every task must report its results to a project log
3) <add more rules here>

The publishing process is very linear but also cyclic as well. A subprocess may need to performed a number of times before process is complete. The following diagram shows the process.
