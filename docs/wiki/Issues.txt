Map menu items are not working, at least the view current model isn't. Suspect the rest are not working either.

File not found error on Watermark feature. If you remove the file from the watermark file field and leave it blank, regardless of if you mark useWatermark true or not, it will give an error. This is not useful. The useWatermark setting should be removed and the presence of a valid file name in the watermark file field should be the trigger. If there is no file present, then it would seem obvious that none is desired.

In ptxplus-manager there is a conflict in displaying characters that use HTML entity refs. When that is enabled it cannot display in the GUI characters such as ¶ or §. For this reason the function that assignes HTML entity refs has been disabled. The name of the function in ptxplus-manager is entity_prep().

Move existing ptxplus system over to TIPE ([[TeX]] Integrated Publishing Environment) project. Initial work has been done on this but many changes were made to ptxplus so it needs to be redone. Hopefully ptxplus will stabilize soon and this can be done.

ptx2pdf - The macro is allowing orphaned words to occur on a line. The default should be two or more words (or maybe 10-15% of the line) on a line at the least. A work around is to either insert a NBSP between the words you want to pull down or use the .adj file to try to pull up a line. Often it will push a couple words down on the last line which is not what you would expect.
